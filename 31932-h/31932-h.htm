SURVEY SHIP MERCY
TO HOSPITAL EARTH</p>

<p class="hd1">TO: Lucius Darby, Physician
Grade I, Black Service Director
of Galactic Periphery Services,
Hospital Earth</p>

<p class="hd1">FROM: Samuel B. Jenkins, Physician
Grade VI, Red Service General
Practice Patrol Ship <i>Lancet</i>
(Attached GSS <i>Mercy</i> pro tem)</p>

<p>SIR: The following communication
is directed to your attention in
hopes that it may anticipate various
charges which are certain to be
placed against me as a Physician of
the Red Service upon the return of
the General Survey Ship <i>Mercy</i> to
Hospital Earth (expected arrival
four months from above date).</p>

<p>These charges will undoubtedly
be preferred by one Turvold Neelsen,
Physician Grade II of the
Black Service, and Commander of
the <i>Mercy</i> on its current survey
mission into the Vorochislov Sector.
Exactly what the charges will
be I cannot say, since the Black
Doctor in question refuses either
audience or communication with
me at the present time; however, it
seems likely that treason, incompetence
and mutinous insubordination
will be among the milder complaints
registered. It is possible that
even Malpractice might be added,
so you can readily understand the
reasons for this statement&mdash;</p>

<p>The following will also clarify
my attached request that the GSS
<i>Mercy</i>, upon arrival in orbit
around Hospital Earth, be met immediately
by a decontamination
ship carrying a vat of hydrochloric
acid, concentration 3.7%, measuring
no less than twenty by thirty by
fifty feet, and that Quarantine officials
be prepared to place the entire
crew of the <i>Mercy</i> under physical
and psychiatric observation for
a period of no less than six weeks
upon disembarkation.</p>

<p>The facts, in brief, are as follows:</p>

<p>Three months ago, as crew of
the General Practice Patrol Ship
<i>Lancet</i>, my colleague Green Doctor
Wallace Stone and myself began
investigating certain peculiar
conditions existing on the fourth
planet of Mauki, Vorochislov Sector
(Class I Medical Service Contract.)
The entire population of
that planet was found to be suffering
from a mass psychotic delusion
of rather spectacular proportions:
namely, that they and their entire
planet were in imminent danger of
being devoured, in toto, by an indestructible
non-humanoid creature
which they called a <i>hlorg</i>.
The Maukivi were insistent that a
<i>hlorg</i> had already totally consumed
a non-existent outer planet
in their system, and was now hard
at work on neighboring Mauki V.
It was their morbid fear that
Mauki IV was next on its list. No
amount of reassurance could convince
them of the foolishness of
these fears, although we exhausted
our energy, our patience, and our
food and medical supplies in the
effort. Ultimately we referred the
matter to the Grey Service, feeling
confident that it was a psychiatric
problem rather than medical or
surgical. We applied to the GSS
<i>Mercy</i> to take us aboard to replenish
our ship's supplies, and provide
us a much-needed recovery period.
The Black Doctor in command approved
our request and brought us
aboard.</p>

<p>The trouble began two days
later....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There were three</span> classes
of dirty words in use by the
men who travelled the spaceways
back and forth from Hospital
Earth.</p>

<p>There were the words you seldom
used in public, but which were
colorful and descriptive in private
use.</p>

<p>Then there were the words
which you seldom used even in private,
but which effectively relieved
feelings when directed at mirrors,
inanimate objects, and people who
had just left the room.</p>

<p>Finally, there were the words
that you just didn't use, period.
You knew they existed; you'd
heard them used at one time or another,
but to hear them spoken out
in plain Earth-English was enough
to rock the most space-hardened of
the Galactic Pill Peddlers back on
his well-worn heels.</p>

<p>Black Doctor Turvold Neelsen's
Earth-English was spotty at best,
but the word came through without
any possibility of misinterpretation.
Red Doctor Sam Jenkins
stared at the little man and felt his
face turning as scarlet as the lining
of his uniform cape.</p>

<p>"But that's ridiculous!" he finally
stammered. "Quite aside from
the language you use to suggest it."</p>

<p>"Ah! So the word still has some
punch left, eh? At least you puppies
bring something away from your
Medical Training, even if it's only
taboos." The Black Doctor scowled
across the desk at Jenkins' lanky
figure. "But sometimes, my good
Doctor, it is better to face a fact
than to wait for the fact to face you.
Sometimes we have to crawl out of
our ivory towers for a minute or
two&mdash;you know?"</p>

<p>Jenkins reddened again. He had
never had any great love for physicians
of the Black Service&mdash;who
did?&mdash;but he found himself disliking
this short, blunt-spoken man
even more cordially than most.
"Why implicate the <i>Lancet</i>?" he
burst out. "You've landed the
<i>Mercy</i> on plenty of planets before
we brought the <i>Lancet</i> aboard
her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we did not have it with us
before the <i>Lancet</i> came aboard,
and we do have it now. The implication
is obvious. You have
brought aboard a contaminant."</p>

<p>He'd said it again.</p>

<p>Red Doctor Jenkins' face darkened.
"The Green Doctor and I
have maintained the <i>Lancet</i> in perfect
conformity with the Sterility
Code. We've taken every precaution
on both landing and disembarking
procedures. What's more,
we've spent the last three months
on a planet with <i>no</i> mutually compatible
flora or fauna. From Hospital
Earth viewpoint, Mauki IV is
sterile. We made only the briefest
check-stop on Mauki V before joining you.
It was a barren rock, but
we decontaminated again after
leaving. If you have a&mdash;a <i>contaminant</i>
on board your ship, sir, it
didn't come from the <i>Lancet</i>. And
I won't be held responsible."</p>

<p>It was strong language to use to
a Black Doctor, and Sam Jenkins
knew it. There were doctors of the
Green and Red Services who had
spent their professional lives on
some god-forsaken planetoid at the
edge of the Galaxy for saying less.
Red Doctor Sam Jenkins was too
near the end of his Internship, too
nearly ready for his first Permanent
Planetary Appointment with the
rank, honor, and responsibility it
carried to lightly risk throwing it to
the wind at this stage&mdash;</p>

<p>But a Red Doctor does not bring
a contaminant aboard a survey
ship, he thought doggedly, no matter
what the Black Doctor says&mdash;</p>

<p>Neelsen looked at the young man
slowly. Then he shrugged. "Of
course, I'm merely a pathologist. I
realize that we know nothing of
medicine, nor of disease, nor of the
manner in which disease is spread.
All this is beyond our scope. But
perhaps you'll permit one simple
question from a dull old man, just
to humor him."</p>

<p>Jenkins looked at the floor. "I'm
sorry, sir."</p>

<p>"Just so. You've had a very successful
cruise this year with the
<i>Lancet</i>, I understand."</p>

<p>Jenkins nodded.</p>

<p>"A most successful cruise. Four
planets elevated from Class IV to
Class II contracts, they tell me.
Morua II elevated from Class VI
to Class I, with certain special riders.
A plague-panic averted on Setman
I, and a very complex virus-bacteria
symbiosis unravelled on
Orb III. An illustrious record. You
and your colleague from the Green
Service are hoping for a year's exemption
from training, I imagine&mdash;"
The Black Doctor looked up
sharply. "You searched your holds
after leaving the Mauki planets, I
presume?"</p>

<p>Jenkins blinked. "Why&mdash;no, sir.
That is, we decontaminated according
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see. You didn't search your
holds. I suppose you didn't notice
your food supplies dwindling at an
alarming rate?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;" The Red Doctor hesitated.
"Not really."</p>

<p>"Ah." The Black Doctor closed
his eyes wearily and flipped an activator
switch. The scanner on the
far wall buzzed into activity. It
focussed on the rear storage hold
of the <i>Mercy</i> where the little
<i>Lancet</i> was resting on its landing
rack. "Look closely, Doctor."</p>

<p>At first Jenkins saw nothing.
Then his eye caught a long, pink
glistening strand lying across the
floor of the hold. The scanner
picked up the strand, followed it to
the place where it emerged from a
neat pencil-sized hole in the hull of
the <i>Lancet</i>. The strand snaked completely
across the room and disappeared
through another neat hole
in the wall into the next storage
hold.</p>

<p>Jenkins shook his head as the
scanner flipped back to the hole
in the <i>Lancet's</i> hull. Even as he
watched, the hole enlarged and a
pink blob began to emerge. The
blob kept coming and coming until
it rested soggily on the edge of the
hole. Then it teetered and fell <i>splat</i>
on the floor.</p>

<p>"Friend of yours?" the Black
Doctor asked casually.</p>

<p>It was a pink heap of jelly just
big enough to fill a scrub bucket. It
sat on the floor, quivering noxiously.
Then it sent out pseudopods in
several directions, probing the
metal floor. After a few moments it
began oozing along the strand of
itself that lay on the floor, and
squeezed through the hole into the
next hold.</p>

<p>"Ugh," said Sam Jenkins, feeling
suddenly sick.</p>

<p>"The hydroponic tanks are in
there," the Black Doctor said.
"You've seen one of those before?"</p>

<p>"Not in person." Jenkins shook
his head weakly. "Only pictures.
It's a <i>hlorg</i>. We thought it was only
a Maukivi persecution fantasy."</p>

<p>"This thing is growing pretty
fast for a persecution fantasy. We
spotted it eight hours ago, demolishing
what was left of your food
supply. It's twice as big now as it
was then."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to get rid of it,"
said Jenkins, suddenly coming to
life.</p>

<p>"Amen, Doctor."</p>

<p>"I'll get the survey crew alerted
right away. We won't waste a minute.
And my apologies." Jenkins
was hurrying for the door. "I'll get
it cleared out of here fast."</p>

<p>"I do hope so," said the Black
Doctor. "The thing makes me ill
just to think about."</p>

<p>"I'll give you a clean-ship report
in twenty-four hours," the Red
Doctor said as confidently as he
could and beat a hasty retreat
down the corridor. He was wishing
fervently that he felt as confident
as he sounded.</p>

<p>The Maukivi had described the
<i>hlorg</i> in excruciating detail. He and
Green Doctor Stone had listened,
and smiled sadly at each other, day
after day, marvelling at the fanciful
delusion. <i>Hlorgs</i>, indeed! And
such creatures to dream up&mdash;eating,
growing, devouring plant, animal
and mineral without discrimination&mdash;</p>

<p>And the Maukivi had stoutly
maintained that this <i>hlorg</i> of theirs
was indestructible&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Green Doctor</span> Wally
Stone, true to his surgical calling,
was a man of action.</p>

<p>"You mean there <i>is</i> such a
thing?" he exploded when his partner
confronted him with the news.
"For real? Not just somebody's
pipe dream?"</p>

<p>"There is," said Jenkins, "and
we've got it. Here. On board the
<i>Mercy</i>. It's eating like hell-and-gone
and doubling its size every
eight hours."</p>

<p>"Well what are you waiting for?
Toss it overboard!"</p>

<p>"Fine! And what happens to the
next party it happens to land on?
We're supposed to be altruists, remember?
We're supposed to worry
about the health of the Galaxy."
Jenkins shook his head. "Whatever
we do with it, we have to find out
just what we're tossing before we
toss."</p>

<p>The creature had made itself at
home aboard the <i>Mercy</i>. In the
spirit of uninvited guests since time
immemorial, it had established a
toehold with remarkable asperity,
and now was digging in for the long
winter. Drawn to the hydroponic
tanks like a flea to a dog, the <i>hlorg</i>
had settled its bulbous pink body
down in their murky depths with a
contented gurgle. As it grew larger
the tank-levels grew lower, the
broth clearer.</p>

<p>The fact that the twenty-five
crewmen of the <i>Mercy</i> depended
on those tanks for their food supply
on the four-month run back to
Hospital Earth didn't seem to
bother the <i>hlorg</i> a bit. It just sank
down wetly and began to eat.</p>

<p>Under Jenkins' whip hand, and
with Green Doctor Stone's assistance,
the Survey Crew snapped
into action. Survey was the soul
and lifeblood of the medical services
supplied by Hospital Earth to
the inhabited planets of the Galaxy.
Centuries before, during the
era of exploration, every Earth ship
had carried a rudimentary Survey
Crew&mdash;a physiologist, a biochemist,
an immunologist, a physician&mdash;to
determine the safety of landings on
unknown planets. Other races were
more advanced in technological
and physical sciences, in sales or in
merchandising&mdash;but in the biological
sciences men of Earth
stood unexcelled in the Galaxy. It
was not surprising that their casual
offerings of medical services wherever
their ships touched had led
to a growing demand for those
services, until the first Medical
Service Contract with Deneb III
had formalized the planetary
specialty. Earth had become Hospital
Earth, physician to a Galaxy,
surgeon to a thousand worlds, midwife
to those susceptible to midwifery
and psychiatrist to those
whose inner lives zigged when their
outer lives zagged.</p>

<p>In the early days it had been a
haphazard arrangement; but gradually
distinct Services appeared to
handle problems of medicine, surgery,
radiology, psychiatry and all
the other functions of a well-appointed
medical service. Under the
direction of the Black Service of
Pathology, Hospital ships and Survey
ships were dispatched to serve
as bases for the tiny General
Practice Patrol ships that answered
the calls of the planets under Contract.</p>

<p>But it was the Survey ships that
did the basic dirty-work on any
new planet taken under Contract&mdash;outlining
the physiological and
biochemical aspects of the races involved,
studying their disease patterns,
their immunological types,
their susceptibility to medical,
surgical, or psychiatric treatment.
It was an exacting service to perform,
and Survey did an exacting
job.</p>

<p>Now, with their own home base
invaded by a hungry pink jelly-blob,
the Survey Crew of the
<i>Mercy</i> dug in with all fours to find
a way to exorcise it.</p>

<p>The early returns were not encouraging.</p>

<p>Bowman, the anatomist, spent
six hours with the creature. He'd
go after the functional anatomy
first, he thought, as he approached
the task with gusto. Special organs,
vital organ systems&mdash;after all,
every Achilles had his heel. Functional
would spot it if anything
would&mdash;</p>

<p>Six hours later he rendered a
preliminary report. It consisted of
a blank sheet of paper and an expression
of wild frustration.</p>

<p>"What's this supposed to mean?"
Jenkins asked.</p>

<p>"Just what it says."</p>

<p>"But it says nothing!"</p>

<p>"That's exactly what it means."
Bowman was a thin, wistful-looking
man with a hawk nose and a little
brown mustache. He subbed as
ship's cook when things were slow
in his specialty. He wasn't a very
good cook, but what could anyone
do with the sludge from the
harvest shelf of a hydroponic tank?
Now, with the <i>hlorg</i> incumbent,
there wasn't even any sludge.</p>

<p>"I drained off a tank and got
a good look at it before it crawled
over into the next one," Bowman
said. "Ugly bastard. But from a
strictly anatomical standpoint I
can't help you a bit."</p>

<p>Green Doctor Stone glowered
over Jenkins' shoulder at the man.
"But surely you can give us <i>something</i>."</p>

<p>Bowman shrugged. "You want it
technical?"</p>

<p>"Any way you like."</p>

<p>"Your <i>hlorg</i> is an ideal anamorph.
A nothing. Protoplasm, just
protoplasm."</p>

<p>Jenkins looked up sharply.
"What about his cellular organization?"</p>

<p>"No cells," said Bowman. "Unless
they're sub-microscopic, and
I'd need an electron-peeker to tell
you that."</p>

<p>"No organ systems?"</p>

<p>"Not even an integument. You
saw how slippery he looked? That's
why. There's nothing holding him
in but energy."</p>

<p>"Now, look," said Stone. "He
eats, doesn't he? He must have
waste materials of some sort."</p>

<p>Bowman shook his head unhappily.
"Sorry. No urates. No nitrates.
No CO<sub>2</sub>. Anyway, he doesn't eat
because he has nothing to eat with.
He absorbs. And that includes the
lining of the tanks, which he seems
to like as much as the contents. He
doesn't <i>bore</i> those holes he makes&mdash;he
<i>dissolves</i> them."</p>

<p>They sent Bowman back to
quarters for a hot bath and a shot
of Happy-O and looked up Hrunta,
the biochemist.</p>

<p>Hrunta was glaring at paper
electrophoretic patterns and pulling
out chunks of hair around his bald
spot. He gave them a snarl and
shoved a sheaf of papers into their
hands.</p>

<p>"Metabolic survey?" Jenkins
asked.</p>

<p>"Plus," said Hrunta. "You're
not going to like it, either."</p>

<p>"Why not? If it grows, it metabolizes.
If it metabolizes, we can
kill it. Axiom number seventeen,
paragraph number four."</p>

<p>"Oh, it metabolizes, all right, but
you'd better find yourself another
axiom, pretty quick."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it not only metabolizes,
it <i>consumes</i>. There's no sign of the
usual protein-carbohydrate-fat metabolism
going on here. This baby
has an enzyme system that's straight
from hell. It bypasses the usual
metabolic activities that produce
heat and energy and gets right
down to basic-basic."</p>

<p>Jenkins swallowed. "What do
you mean?"</p>

<p>"It attacks the nuclear structure
of whatever matter the creature
comes in contact with. There's a
partial mass-energy conversion in
its rawest form. The creature goes
after carbon-bearing substances
first, since the C seems to break
down more easily than anything else&mdash;hence
its preference for plant and
animal material over non-C stuff.
But it can use anything if it has
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jenkins stared at the little biochemist,
an image in his mind of
the pink creature in the hold, growing
larger by the minute as it ate
its way through the hydroponics,
through the dry stores, through&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is there anything it <i>can't</i> use?"</p>

<p>"If there is, I haven't found it,"
Hrunta said sadly. "In fact, I can't
see any reason why it couldn't consume
this ship and everything in it,
right down to the last rivet&mdash;"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They walked down</span> to
the hold for another look at
their uninvited guest, and almost
wished they hadn't.</p>

<p>It had reached the size of a
small hippopotamus, although the
resemblance ended there. Twenty
hours had elapsed since the survey
had begun. The <i>hlorg</i> had used
every minute of it, draining the
tanks, engulfing dry stores, devouring
walls and floors as it spread out
in search of food, leaving trails of
eroded metal wherever it went.</p>

<p>It was ugly&mdash;ugly in its pink
shapelessness, ugly in its slimy half-sentient
movements, in its very <i>purposefulness</i>.
But its ugliness went
even deeper, stirring primordial
feelings of revulsion and loathing in
their minds as they watched it
oozing implacably across the hold
to another dry-storage bin.</p>

<p>Wally Stone shuddered. "It's
<i>grown</i>."</p>

<p>"Too fast. Bowman charts it as
geometric progression."</p>

<p>Stone scratched his jaw as a
lone pink pseudopod pushed out
on the floor toward him. Then he
leaped forward and stamped on it,
severing the strand from the body.</p>

<p>The severed member quivered
and lay still for a moment. Then it
flowed back to rejoin the body with
a wet gurgle.</p>

<p>Stone looked at his half-dissolved
shoe.</p>

<p>"Egotropism," Jenkins said.
"Bowman played around with that,
too. A severed piece will rejoin if
it can. If it can't it just takes up
independent residence and we have
two <i>hlorgs</i>."</p>

<p>"What happens to it outside
the ship?" Stone wanted to know.</p>

<p>"It falls dormant for several
hours, and then splits up into a
thousand independent chunks. One
of the boys spent half of yesterday
out there gathering them up. I tell
you, this thing is equipped to <i>survive</i>."</p>

<p>"So are we," said Green Doctor
Stone grimly. "If we can't outwit
this free-flowing gob of obscenity,
we deserve anything we get.
Let's have a conference."</p>

<p>They met in the pilot room. The
Black Doctor was there; so were
Bowman and Hrunta. Chambers,
the physiologist, was glumly clasping
and unclasping his hands in a
corner. The geneticist, Piccione,
drew symbols on a scratch pad and
stared blankly at the wall.</p>

<p>Jenkins was saying: "Of course,
these are only preliminary reports,
but they serve to outline the problem.
This is not just an annoyance
any longer, it's a crisis. We'd all
better understand that."</p>

<p>The Black Doctor cut him off
with a wave of his hand, and
glowered at the papers as he read
them through minutely. As he sat
hunched at the desk with the black
cowl of his office hanging down
from his shoulders he looked like
a squat black judge, Jenkins
thought, a shadow from the Inquisition,
a Passer of Spells. But
there was no medievalism in Black
Doctor Neelsen. In fact, it was for
that reason, and only that reason,
that the Black Service had come
to be the leaders and the whips,
the executors and directors of all
the manifold operations of Hospital
Earth.</p>

<hr />

<p>The physicians of the General
Practice Patrol were fledglings,
newly trained in their specialties,
inexperienced in the rigorous discipline
of medicine that was required
of the directors of permanent
Planetary Dispensaries in the
heavily populated systems of the
Galaxy. On outlying worlds where
little was known of the ways of
medicine, the temptation was great
to substitute faith for knowledge,
cant for investigation, nonsense
rituals for hard work. But the
physicians of the Black Service
were always waiting to jerk wandering
neophytes back to the scientific
disciplines that made the service
of Hospital Earth so effective.
The Black Doctors would not
tolerate sloppiness. "Show me the
tissue, Doctor," they would say.
"Prove to me that what you say
is so. Prove that what you did was
valid medicine...." Their laboratories
were the morgues and autopsy
rooms of a thousand planets, the
Temples of Truth from which no
physician since the days of Pasteur
and Lister could escape for long
and retain his position.</p>

<p>The Black Doctors were the
pragmatists, the gadflies of Hospital
Earth.</p>

<p>For this reason it was surprising
to hear Black Doctor Neelsen saying,
"Perhaps we are being too
scientific, just now. When the
creature has exhausted our food
stores, it will look elsewhere for
food. Perhaps we must cut at the
tree and not at the root."</p>

<p>"A frontal attack?" said Jenkins.</p>

<p>"Just so. Its enzyme system is
its vulnerability. Enzyme systems
operate under specific optimum
conditions, right? And every known
enzyme system can be inactivated
by adverse conditions of one sort
or another. A physical approach
may tell us how in this case. Meanwhile
we will be on emergency
rations, and hope that we don't
starve to death finding out." The
Black Doctor paused, looking at
the men around him. "And in case
you are thinking of enlisting help
from outside, forget it. I've sent
plague-warnings out for Galactic
relay. We have this thing isolated,
and we're going to keep it that
way as long as I command this
ship."</p>

<p>They went gloomily back to their
laboratories to plan their frontal
attack.</p>

<p>That was the night that Hrunta
disappeared.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He was gone</span> when they
came to wake him from his
sleep period. His bunk had been
slept in, but he wasn't in it. In
fact, he wasn't anywhere on the
ship.</p>

<p>"But he couldn't just vanish!"
the Black Doctor burst out when
they told him the news. "Maybe
he's hiding somewhere. Maybe this
business was working on his mind."</p>

<p>Green Doctor Stone took a crew
of men to search the ship again,
even though he considered it a
waste of precious time. He had his
private convictions about where
Hrunta had gone.</p>

<p>So did every other man on the
ship, including Jenkins.</p>

<p>The <i>hlorg</i> had stopped eating.
Huge and round and wet and ugly,
it squatted in the after-hold, quivering
gently, without any other sign
of life.</p>

<p>Surfeited. Like a fat man after
a turkey dinner.</p>

<p>Jenkins reviewed progress with
the others. No stone had been left
unturned. They had sliced the
<i>hlorg</i>, and squeezed it. They had
boiled it and frozen it. They had
dropped chunks of it in acid vats
and covered other chunks with
desiccants and alkalis. Nothing
seemed to bother it.</p>

<p>A cold environment slowed down
its activity, true, but it also stimulated
the process of fission. Warmed
up again, the portions sucked back
together again and resumed eating.</p>

<p>Heat was a little more effective,
but not much. It stunned the
creature for a brief period, but it
would not burn. It hissed frightfully
and gave off an overpowering
stench, and curled up at the edges,
but as soon as the heat was turned
off it began to recover.</p>

<p>In Hrunta's lab chunks of the
<i>hlorg</i> sat in a dozen vats on tables
and in sinks. Some contained
antibiotics, some concentrated
acids, some desiccants. In each vat
a blob of pink protoplasm wiggled
happily, showing no sign of discomfiture.
On another table were
the remains of Hrunta's (unsuccessful)
attempt to prepare an anti-<i>hlorg</i>
serum.</p>

<p>But no Hrunta.</p>

<p>"He was down there with the
thing all day," Bowman said sadly.
"He felt it was his responsibility,
really. Hrunta thought biochemistry
was the answer to all things, of
course. Very conscientious man."</p>

<p>"But he was in <i>bed</i>."</p>

<p>"He claimed he did his best
thinking in bed. Maybe he had a
brainstorm and went down to try
it out, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes." Jenkins nodded sourly.
"And." He walked down the row
of vats. "You'd think that at least
concentrated sulphuric would dessicate
it a little. But it's just formed
a crust of coagulated protein
around itself, and sits there&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bowman peered over his shoulder,
his mustache twitching. "But
it does dessicate."</p>

<p>"If you use enough long enough."</p>

<p>"How about concentrated hydrochloric?"</p>

<p>"Same thing. Maybe a little
more effective, but not enough to
count."</p>

<p>"Okay. Next we try combinations.
There's got to be <i>something</i>
the wretched beast can't tolerate&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was, of course.</p>

<hr />

<p>Green Doctor Stone brought it
to Jenkins as he was getting ready
to turn in for a sleep period.
Jenkins had checked to make sure
double guards were posted in the
<i>hlorg's</i> vicinity, and jolted them
with Sleep-Not to keep them on
their toes. All the same, he tied a
length of stout cord around his
ankle just to make sure he didn't
do any sleepwalking. He was tying
it to the bunk when Stone came
in with a pan in his hand and a
peculiar look on his face.</p>

<p>"Take a look at this," he said.</p>

<p>Jenkins looked at the sickly
brown mass in the tray, and then
up at Stone. "Where did you find
it?"</p>

<p>"Down in the hold. Our <i>hlorg</i>
has broken precedent. It's <i>rejected</i>
something that it ate."</p>

<p>"Yeah. What is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm taking it to
Neelsen for paraffin sections. But
I know what it looks like to me."</p>

<p>"Mm. I know." Jenkins felt sick.
Stone headed up to the path lab,
leaving the Red Doctor settled in
his bunk.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Jenkins sat
bolt upright in the darkness. Frantically
he untied himself and slid
into his clothes. "Idiot!" he growled
to himself. "Seventh son of a
seventh son&mdash;"</p>

<p>Five minutes later he was staring
at the vats in Hrunta's laboratory.
He found the one he was
looking for. A pink blob of <i>hlorg</i>
wiggled slowly around the bottom.</p>

<p>Jenkins drew a beaker of distilled
water and added it to the fluid in
the vat. It hissed and sputtered
and sent up quantities of acrid
steam. When the steam had cleared
away, Jenkins peered in eagerly.</p>

<p>The pink thing in the bottom was
turning a sickly violet. It had quit
wiggling. As Jenkins watched, the
violet color changed to mud grey,
then to black. He prodded it with
a stirring rod. There was no response.</p>

<p>With a whoop Jenkins buzzed
Bowman and Stone. "We've got it!"
he shouted to them when they appeared.
"Look! Look at it!"</p>

<p>Bowman poked and probed and
broke into a wide grin. The piece of
<i>hlorg</i> was truly and sincerely dead.
"It inactivates the enzyme system,
and renders the base protoplasm
vulnerable to anything that normally
attacks it. What are we waiting
for?"</p>

<p>They began tearing the laboratory
apart, searching for the right
bottles. The supply was discouragingly
small, but there was some in
stock. The three of them raced
down the corridor for the hold
where the <i>hlorg</i> was.</p>

<p>It took them three hours of angry
work to exhaust the supply. They
whittled chunks off the <i>hlorg</i>,
tossed them in pans of the deadly
fluid. With each slice they stopped
momentarily to watch it turn
violet, then black, as it died. The
<i>hlorg</i>, dwindling in size, sensed the
attack and slapped frantically at
their ankles, sending out angry
plumes of wet jelly, but they ducked
and dodged and whittled some
more. The <i>hlorg</i> quivered and gurgled
and wept pinkish goo all over
the floor, but it grew smaller and
weaker with every whack.</p>

<p>"Hrunta must have spotted it
and come down here alone,"
Jenkins panted between slices.
"Maybe he slipped, lost his footing,
I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>They continued to work until
the supply was exhausted. They had
reduced the <i>hlorg</i> to a quarter its
previous size. "Check the other labs,
see if they have some more," said
Stone.</p>

<p>"I already have," Bowman said.
"They don't. This is it."</p>

<p>"But we haven't got it all killed.
There's still&mdash;" He pointed to the
thing quailing in the corner.</p>

<p>"I know. We're licked, that's all.
There isn't any more of the stuff
on the ship."</p>

<p>They stopped and looked at each
other suddenly. Then Jenkins said:
"Oh, yes there is."</p>

<p>There was silence. Bowman
looked at Stone, and Stone looked
at Bowman. They both looked at
Jenkins. "Oh, no. Sorry. I decline."
Stone shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"But we have to! There's no
other way. If the enzyme system is
inactivated, it's just protoplasm&mdash;there's
no physiological or biochemical reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know what you can do
with your physiology and biochemistry,"
Bowman said succinctly.
"You can also count me out." He
left them and the hatchway clanged
after him.</p>

<p>"Wally?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"It'll be months before we get
back to Hospital Earth. We know
how we can hold it in check until
we get there."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Green Doctor Wally Stone
sighed. "Greater love hath no
man," he said wearily. "We'd better
go tell Neelsen, I guess."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Black Doctor</span> Turvold
Neelsen's answer was a flat,
unequivocal no. "It's monstrous
and preposterous. I won't stand
for it. Nobody will stand for it."</p>

<p>"But you have the proof in your
own hands," Jenkins said. "You
saw the specimen that the Green
Doctor brought you."</p>

<p>Neelsen hunched back angrily.
"I saw it."</p>

<p>"And your impression of it? As
a pathologist?"</p>

<p>"I fail to see how my impression
applies one way or the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doctor, sometimes we have to
face facts. Remember?"</p>

<p>"All right." Neelsen seemed to
curl up into himself still further.
"The specimen was stomach."</p>

<p>"Human stomach?"</p>

<p>"Human stomach."</p>

<p>"But the only human on this
ship that doesn't have a stomach is
Hrunta," said Jenkins.</p>

<p>"So the <i>hlorg</i> ate him."</p>

<p>"<i>Most</i> of him. Not quite all. It
threw out the one part of him it
couldn't eat. The part containing
a substance that inactivated its
enzyme system. Dilute hydrochloric
acid, to be specific. We used the
entire ship's supply, and cut the
<i>hlorg</i> down to three-quarters size,
but we need a continuous supply
to keep it whittled down until we
get home. And there's only one
good, permanent, reliable source
of dilute hydrochloric acid on board
this ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Black Doctor's face was
purple. "I said no," he choked. "My
answer stands."</p>

<p>The Red Doctor sighed and
turned to Green Doctor Stone. "All
right, Wally," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>(<i>From the files of the Medical
Disciplinary Board, Hospital Earth,
op. cit.</i>)</p>

<p>I am certain that you can see
from the foregoing that a reasonable
effort was made by Green
Doctor Stone and myself to put
the plan in effect peaceably and
with full approval of our commander.
It was our conviction,
however, that the emergency nature
of the circumstances required that
it be done with or without his
approval. Our subsequent success
in containing the <i>hlorg</i> to at least
reasonable and manageable proportions
should bear out the wisdom of
our decision.</p>

<p>Actually, it has not been as bad
as one might think. It has been
necessary to confine the crew to
their quarters, and to restrain the
Black Doctor forcibly, but with
liberal use of Happy-O we can occasionally
convince ourselves that
it is rare beefsteak, and the Green
Doctor, our pro-tem cook has concocted
several very tasty sauces,
such as mushroom, onion, etc. We
reduce the <i>hlorg</i> to half its size
each day, and if thoroughly heated
the chunks lie still on the plate for
quite some time.</p>

<p>No physical ill effects have been
noted, and the period of quarantine
is recommended solely to allow the
men an adequate period for psychological
recovery.</p>

<p>I have only one further recommendation:
that the work team
from the Grey Service be recalled
at once from their assignment on
Mauki IV. The problem is decidedly
not psychiatric, and it would be
one of the tragedies of the ages if
our excellent psychiatric service
were to succeed in persuading the
Maukivi out of their 'delusion'.</p>

<p>After all, Hospital Earth cannot
afford to jeopardize a Contract&mdash;</p>
